<h1>Project 1  - Personal Portfolio</h1>

<p>This project required the creation of a personal portfolio website offering appealing design, with the flexibility of being easily added to over time.

<p>All links on the website lead to the correct sections of the webpages and the social icons lead to appropriate external websites, including my GitHub page. The site is also suitable for viewing from a range of devices. This was acheived by utilising Chrome Dev Tools responsive toggling and the appropriate implementation of media queries.</p>

<p>Colour scheme was chosen with a view to being interesting whilst still being easy on the eye. Usgae of whitespace allowed for clear visual distinction of sections and increased user experience.</P>

I chose a pleasant sans-serif font to increase user experience and accessibility.

However, the form would not flag 'required' on empty input fields, despie my adding 'required' at the end of each HTML code line (which was not included in the tutorial). The solution to this was that the button type required changing from 'button' to 'submit'. I sourced the solution from this wonderful resource: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_required.asp
